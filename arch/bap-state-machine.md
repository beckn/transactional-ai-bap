# Agentic Workflow Explainer for a BAP in Beckn Protocol

This document explains each node (agent) in the agentic workflow of a Buyer Aggregator Platform (BAP) based on the Beckn protocol. Each agent plays a crucial role in handling specific tasks during the buyer's journey.

## Nodes (Agents)

### 1. **Agent Orchestrator**
The **Agent Orchestrator** is the central node responsible for coordinating the flow of actions and tasks across all other agents. It decides which agent should handle a particular request at any given point in the user's journey.
